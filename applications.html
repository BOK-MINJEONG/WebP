          <p>
            AI technology is utilized in various medical fields such as disease
            diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring systems. For
            example, AI can analyze medical images to diagnose diseases more
            quickly and accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
            A notable example is IBM's Watson Health. Watson Health analyzes
            vast amounts of medical data to aid in diagnosis, treatment
            planning, and patient management. It can propose customized
            treatments by analyzing a specific patient's medical records,
            genetic information, and clinical research data.

          <p>
            The development of autonomous vehicles is another major application
            of AI. AI helps vehicles recognize their surroundings and make
            appropriate decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tesla's autonomous vehicles use AI to perceive their environment and
            drive the car automatically based on this information. Real-time
            data analysis allows the car to recognize traffic conditions and
            obstacles and select the optimal route. Autonomous vehicles can
            reduce driver fatigue and lower accident rates.

          />
          <p>
            AI is widely used in financial services for financial analysis, risk
            management, and customer service improvement. For instance, AI helps
            prevent financial fraud through large-scale data analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of AI in financial services is automated investment
            advice services. Robo-advisors analyze users' investment goals and
            risk preferences to automatically manage investment portfolios.
            Companies like Betterment provide optimized investment strategies
            tailored to clients' goals, offering cost-effective personalized
            investment management.

            alt="Predix logo image"
            title="Predix logo"
          />
          <p>
            AI is applied in various aspects of manufacturing including process
            optimization, quality control, and inventory management. AI-powered
            predictive maintenance can prevent machinery failures and enhance
            productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            GE's Predix, an industrial internet platform, collects and analyzes
            data from manufacturing equipment to monitor their condition and
            enable predictive maintenance, thereby increasing productivity and
            reducing maintenance costs.

          />
          <p>
            AI plays a crucial role in retail by analyzing customer purchasing
            patterns, providing personalized shopping experiences, and
            optimizing inventory management. AI chatbots are also used to
            improve customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amazon Go is a cashier-less store that utilizes AI and machine
            learning technologies. When customers enter the store and pick up
            items, advanced sensors and algorithms automatically recognize the
            items in their shopping cart and bill them directly to their
            accounts without the need for a checkout process, offering a
            convenient shopping experience without waiting in line.
