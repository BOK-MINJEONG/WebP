        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>
          According to a
          <a
            href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/analytics/assets/pwc-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize-report.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >PwC report</a
          >, by 2030, artificial intelligence is expected to add up to $15.7
          trillion to the global GDP. China and North America are expected to
          lead this growth, potentially increasing their GDPs by approximately
          26% and 14.5% respectively through AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          McKinsey research anticipates that about 70% of businesses will
          implement AI in some form by 2030.

          <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
          <p>Enhances production efficiency.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            AI has the potential to save the healthcare industry more than $150
            billion annually. It will particularly impact diagnostics, patient
            management, and optimization of treatment protocols.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Automotive Industry</h3>
          <p>
            With the commercialization of autonomous vehicles, the global market
            for self-driving cars is expected to grow to over $60 billion by
            2025.

        <h2>Operational Improvement</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Customer Self-service</h3>
          <p>
            Generative AI-powered chatbots can provide immediate and
            personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of
            the customer's language or location. By enhancing the quality and
            efficiency of interactions through automated channels, generative AI
            can automate responses to more customer inquiries, allowing customer
            service teams to handle queries that only human agents can resolve.
            According to McKinsey, about half of all customer inquiries handled
            by banks, telecommunications, and utilities in North America are
            already processed by machines, including AI. Depending on the
            existing level of automation within a company, using generative AI
            could reduce the volume of customer inquiries handled directly by
            people by up to 50%.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Problem Resolution at First Contact</h3>
          <p>
            Generative AI can immediately access data a company holds on a
            specific customer, helping human customer service agents to more
            successfully respond to questions and resolve issues during initial
            interactions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Reduction in Response Time</h3>
          <p>
            Generative AI can provide support in real-time and recommend next
            steps, reducing the time human sales agents spend engaging with
            customers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Revenue Increase</h3>
          <p>
            This technology's ability to quickly process data about customers
            and their search history allows it to identify product suggestions
            and transactions that align with customer preferences. Additionally,
            generative AI can gather insights from customer conversations, find
            better methods, and coach agents, thereby improving quality
            assurance and coaching. McKinsey estimates that applying generative
            AI to customer management functions could increase productivity by
            30-45% of current function costs.

        <h2>Employment Changes</h2>
        <p>
          According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report, by 2025, artificial
          intelligence and automation technologies are expected to displace
          about 85 million jobs, but at the same time, create approximately 97
          million new jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is estimated that about 120 million workers will need retraining
          from 2022 to 2030 to adapt to AI and automation.

        <h2>Ethical Considerations and Regulation</h2>
        <p>
          The European Union has implemented GDPR, one of the strictest
          regulations in the world concerning AI and data protection, and the
          United States and China are also strengthening regulations on the use
          of AI. More detailed regulations are expected to emerge in the future.
