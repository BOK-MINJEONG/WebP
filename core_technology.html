            Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) and
            computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to
            emulate the way that humans learn, gradually improving accuracy. It
            involves developing algorithms that learn patterns and make
            predictions from data, including supervised, unsupervised, and
            reinforcement learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of explicitly programming computers to perform specific
            tasks, machine learning focuses on training computers to learn from
            data and improve through experience. Algorithms in machine learning
            are trained to find patterns and correlations in large datasets and
            make optimal decisions and predictions based on analyses. Machine
            learning applications improve through deployment and become more
            accurate as more data becomes available.

          <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
          <p>
            Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach that
            teaches computers to process data in a manner inspired by the human
            brain, used to solve complex problems like image recognition, speech
            recognition, and natural language processing. Deep learning methods
            can be used to automate tasks that typically require human
            intelligence, such as describing images or converting sound files to
            text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have solved issues with traditional
            multilayer perceptrons are characterized as follows:

            Deep learning is used in various applications in sectors like
            automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, electronics, medical research,
            and others. Here are some examples of deep learning applications:

          <p>
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial
            intelligence that involves giving computers the ability to
            understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings
            can.
          </p>
          <p>
            NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human
            language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning
            models. These technologies enable computers to process human
            language in the form of text or voice data and understand the full
            meaning, including the intent and sentiment of the speaker or
            writer. This technology is used in translation, sentiment analysis,
            chatbots, and more.

          <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that
            trains computers and systems to interpret the visual world. Using
            digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, it extracts
            meaningful information, which is then used to perform actions based
            on this data. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision
            enables them to see, observe, and understand.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some examples of computer vision applications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Image classification</li>
            <li>Object detection</li>
            <li>Object tracking</li>
            <li>Content-based image retrieval</li>

          <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
          <img

            alt="Reinforcement_Learning image"
            title="Reinforcement_Learning"
          />
          <p>
            Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that finds its objective
            through trial and error and learning through mistakes and rewards,
            similar to how traditional neural networks learn weights and biases
            using data with known outcomes using rewards to learn weights and
            biases.
            <b>The goal is to learn the optimal behavior or policy.</b>
