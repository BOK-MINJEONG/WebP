        <p>
          In 1950, British mathematician Alan Turing described in his paper
          "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" a test to determine if machines
          can think, the feasibility of developing intelligent machines, and
          learning machines. The Turing machine, actualized from these
          technologies, influenced directly/indirectly John von Neumann,
          becoming the standard of modern computer architecture and is
          considered the start of the history of artificial intelligence.

        <h2>Development of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Since the 1970s, most companies have focused their R&D towards
          practical statistical techniques. Modern statistics began in the early
          20th century, led by scholars like Fisher and Pearson in the UK and
          Genichi Taguchi in Japan. They showed that experimental design methods
          and statistical analysis techniques could improve manufacturing
          quality and production efficiency.
          <br />
          These concepts have been used in the industry as tools to resolve
          inefficiencies under the name of data mining and have established the
          foundations of big data technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence research quieted down for a while but spread
          in earnest in the 1980s with the introduction of expert systems in the
          industry. Expert systems consist of:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Database of knowledge and experience</li>
          <li>Decision-making inference engine</li>
          <li>User interface</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At that time, inference engine technologies primarily used
          Bayesian-based probabilistic methods and another approach utilizing
          multi-value logic through Fuzzy theory. Fuzzy expert systems stood as
          the representative technology of AI for a while, but as their massive
          management needs and limited return on investment became apparent, AI
          research weakened, and most research shifted towards supercomputers
          and simulation fields in 1993, starting in the USA.
          <br />
          During this dark period for AI, techniques like reinforcement learning
          for machine control, advocated by Richard Bellman, and statistical
          methods for quality control, promoted by George Box and other Japanese
          quality researchers, were applied in industry. Meanwhile,
          groundbreaking AI research such as backpropagation, the foundation of
          deep learning, was published but went unnoticed due to computer
          performance limitations and was replaced by machine learning
          algorithms.

        <h2>The Rise of Deep Learning and Machine Learning</h2>
        <img src="img/Hinton.jpg" alt="Hinton image" width="200" height="200" />
        <p>
          By the 2000s, deep learning technologies based on Professor Hinton's
          Deep Belief Networks began to show practical potential. Particularly,
          Deep-CNN marked significant achievements in image recognition
          performance, prompting a reevaluation of neural network-based AI
          technologies among experts. For instance, after proving the potential
          of deep learning, Google acquired DeepMind Technologies for $400
          million in 2014.
          <br />
          Subsequently, in 2016, AlphaGo 1.0 defeated Lee Sedol, and in 2017,
          AlphaGo 2.0 (based on unsupervised learning with minimal data
          self-learning) won against Ke Jie and other top-class Go players,
          solidifying AI's recognition among the general public and marking a
          complete reevaluation of the technology.
          <br />
          The steady progress since then has started showing results in other
          research areas that seemed impractical, and AI has been rapidly
          advancing since the emergence of deep learning.

        <h2>The Present and the Future</h2>
        <p>
          The development of AI has seen remarkable growth over the past
          decades, and its prospects for both the present and the future are
          very bright. Today, artificial intelligence is used in various fields
          such as natural language processing technologies developed by OpenAI
          like GPT-3, computer vision technologies used in Apple's Face ID, and
          autonomous vehicles, and it is expected that AI technologies will
          become more sophisticated and utilized in all aspects of human life.
